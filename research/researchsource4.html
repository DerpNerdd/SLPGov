        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This PMC article examines the epidemiology of teen driving accidents, focusing on patterns and trends that contribute to high crash rates among young drivers. The study analyzes data to identify common risk factors, such as night driving and the presence of passengers. It highlights the effectiveness of targeted interventions, like graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs, in reducing accident rates. The article also discusses the role of technology in monitoring and improving teen driving behavior. By providing a comprehensive overview of teen driving risks, the research supports evidence-based strategies for enhancing road safety. The findings underscore the need for collaborative efforts among parents, educators, and policymakers to address these challenges.</p>
