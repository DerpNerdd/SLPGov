        <h2>The Issue with Teen Driving</h2>
        <p>Teen driving can be significantly more dangerous due to inexperience, risk-taking behaviors, and distractions. Statistics show that teenagers are more likely to be involved in accidents compared to other age groups. The combination of limited driving experience and a sense of invincibility often leads to poor decision-making on the road. Educating teens on safe driving practices and enforcing stricter driving laws can help mitigate these risks.</p>
