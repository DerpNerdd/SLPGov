                <h2>Definition of Federalism</h2>
                <p>Federalism is a system of government in which power is divided between a central authority and constituent political units, such as states or provinces. This structure allows for a balance of power, enabling both national and local governments to enact laws and regulations pertinent to their specific jurisdictions.</p>
                <p>One of the fundamental aspects of federalism is its ability to prevent the concentration of power by distributing authority. This system empowers regions to address their unique needs and circumstances, ensuring that governance is responsive and tailored at a local level. In the United States, federalism is a core principle embedded in the Constitution, influencing how policies are developed and implemented across different levels of government.</p>
                <p>Federalism also fosters innovation in policy-making, as states can serve as "laboratories of democracy." This means they can experiment with new ideas and solutions to policy challenges without impacting the entire nation. Successful policies can then be adopted by other states or even at the national level, contributing to a dynamic and adaptive governance system.</p>

                <h2>Connection to Teen Driving</h2>
                <p>Federalism plays a critical role in shaping teen driving regulations across the United States. The federal government sets broad safety standards and initiatives to protect all road users, including teen drivers, through agencies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). These standards provide a framework for ensuring vehicle safety and promoting best practices nationwide.</p>
                <p>However, the responsibility for implementing specific driving laws and licensing requirements falls to state governments. This division of power allows states to tailor their driving regulations to address local concerns, such as traffic patterns, accident rates, and public opinion. For example, some states might enforce stricter graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs to reduce teen crash rates, while others focus on educational campaigns to promote safe driving habits among young drivers.</p>
                <p>The collaboration between federal and state authorities helps create comprehensive policies that enhance teen driving safety. By leveraging the strengths of federalism, states can adopt innovative approaches to teen driving regulation, ensuring that their policies are effective and responsive to the needs of their communities. This system also encourages dialogue and cooperation between different levels of government, fostering a holistic approach to addressing the challenges of teen driving.</p>
