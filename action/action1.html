                <h2>What Has Worked</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) systems have significantly reduced teen crash rates by gradually introducing driving privileges.</li>
                    <li>Strict enforcement of seatbelt laws has increased compliance and reduced injuries among teen drivers.</li>
                    <li>Parental involvement in setting driving rules and monitoring behavior has been shown to improve teen driving safety.</li>
                    <li>Use of technology, such as apps that block texting while driving, has helped decrease distracted driving incidents.</li>
                    <li>Driver education programs that emphasize real-world scenarios and practical skills have improved teen driver preparedness.</li>
                    <li>Public awareness campaigns have raised consciousness about the dangers of impaired and distracted driving.</li>

                <h2>What Needs Improvement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to affordable and comprehensive driver education programs remains limited in some areas.</li>
                    <li>There is a need for more consistent enforcement of distracted driving laws across different regions.</li>
                    <li>Improving the design of roads and intersections to better accommodate novice drivers can enhance safety.</li>
                    <li>Efforts to engage minority and underserved communities in driving safety initiatives need strengthening.</li>

                <h2>Other Countries</h2>
                <p>In Sweden, the focus on road safety is deeply ingrained in the culture, with a strong emphasis on education and training for young drivers. The country implements a Vision Zero policy, aiming to eliminate all road fatalities and serious injuries. Swedish teens undergo extensive driver education, including both theoretical knowledge and practical experience. They are also encouraged to participate in advanced driving courses that cover high-risk scenarios and defensive driving techniques. The combination of strict laws, comprehensive education, and a societal commitment to safety has resulted in Sweden having one of the lowest rates of traffic accidents involving young drivers.</p>

                <p>In Japan, the legal driving age is higher at 18, which helps ensure that young drivers have more maturity before getting behind the wheel. The licensing process is rigorous, requiring both written tests and practical driving exams that emphasize safety and skill. Additionally, Japan mandates a series of driving lessons with professional instructors, which must be completed before a license is granted. This thorough approach leads to a higher level of preparedness among new drivers. The focus on safety and discipline contributes to Japan having one of the lower accident rates among young drivers globally.</p>

                <p>In Australia, the graduated licensing system requires young drivers to gain extensive experience through a phased approach. This includes a learner period, where drivers must log a minimum number of supervised hours before advancing to a provisional license. Australian teen drivers also face restrictions on nighttime driving and passenger limits, aimed at reducing high-risk situations. Public awareness campaigns are widespread, often featuring impactful messaging to discourage behaviors like speeding and distracted driving. These comprehensive measures have contributed to a significant reduction in road incidents involving young drivers.</p>

                <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
                <p>Despite progress, there are still challenges in addressing teen driving safety. The cost of driver education can be prohibitive for some families, limiting access to proper training. Additionally, inconsistencies in law enforcement and penalties can undermine the effectiveness of safety measures. Cultural attitudes towards driving and risk-taking also influence teen behavior, often requiring targeted interventions. Furthermore, rapid advancements in technology, such as smartphones, present ongoing challenges in combating distracted driving. Efforts to address these drawbacks must be comprehensive and adaptable to changing conditions.</p>

                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>A goal for the future is to increase access to driver education for all teens. This can be achieved by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subsidizing driver education costs for low-income families.</li>
                    <li>Implementing online driver education programs for greater accessibility.</li>
                    <li>Partnering with schools to offer free or reduced-cost courses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another goal is to enhance enforcement of existing driving laws. Steps to achieve this include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increasing funding for traffic law enforcement agencies.</li>
                    <li>Implementing technology to monitor and report infractions.</li>
                    <li>Engaging communities in supporting law enforcement efforts.</li>
