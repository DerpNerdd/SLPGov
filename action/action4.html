            <h2>My Letter</h2>
            <p>December 19, 2024</p>
            <p>The Honorable Travis Grantham<br>
            United States House of Representatives<br>
            House of Representatives 1700 West Washington<br>
            Phoenix, Arizona 85007</p>

            <p>Dear Representative Grantham,</p>
            <p>My name is Alan Sanchez, and I am a current student at Mountain Ridge High School. I have been working in an Advanced Placement course in Government and Politics which requires me to participate in a Service Learning Project on safety for teenage drivers. I write to express my full support for the legislation that would make driving education compulsory for all teenage drivers in Arizona, along with certain other measures that will go hand in hand with enhanced safety for teen drivers in our state.</p>

            <p>Teen driving has become an alarmingly common concern from a safety perspective that does not affect only the local community but nationwide. Statistically, car accidents are considered the main cause of death among teenagers.</p>

            <p>The Arizona roadways have often been known to be some of the worst to drive on, holding the least forgiveness for a driver who has little experience. Ensuring all teens go through driving education can provide them with basic skills to navigate these environments safely. Along with basic driving skills, the program of study should also focus on how to practically apply defensive driving principles, accident-avoidance techniques, and the critical importance of maintaining focus and minimizing distractions. Second, driver training needs to be improved constantly. The longer the training, the greater the knowledge of adolescents regarding traffic rules and road signs, as well as the actual consequences of hazardous behavior such as speeding and intoxication. A good curriculum, mixed with relevant examples and interactive teaching methods, would form a backdrop for teenagers in case they experience anything on the roads. It should extend beyond the minimum competence in driving to the instillation of good judgment and decision-making that lasts a lifetime.</p>

            <p>Besides the required courses and increased education programs, reform through the use of policy change is necessary to support these approaches. This includes supporting the continued strengthening of GDL policies, which allow novices to learn to drive under safer conditions and have reduced teen crash rates. Stronger GDL policies that include such components as longer periods of supervised driving and restrictions on night driving and transporting teenage passengers can further improve safety.</p>

            <p>Such a policy implementation would create a systematic framework that guides teens into responsible driving practices. This, in essence, would socially support the safety of teen drivers. Parents and schools, among other affiliations, would be involved in a consensus on the development of optimal practices for road safety.</p>

            <p>Distracted and impaired driving calls for collective activities and campaigns to raise greater awareness, creating a safety culture that is more than just the driver alone but involves the entire community. This can be accomplished as one together in building a supportive environment that empowers teens to make responsible decisions and instills driving confidence. I would like to commend these individuals for their leadership concerning such an important issue. The proposal for required driving classes shows quite an amount of concern for the future of Arizona's youth. Please let me know how I can help, whether it be with community outreach, education, or even public awareness meetings. Thank you for your attention and consideration of my petition. I am optimistic that together we can effect meaningful reform to protect the futures of our young drivers.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,<br>Alan Sanchez<br>sanchez1.alan1@gmail.com</p>
